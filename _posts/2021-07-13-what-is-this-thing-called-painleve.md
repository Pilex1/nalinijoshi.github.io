title: "What is this thing called Painlev&eacute;?"

Imagine you want to define &ldquo;new&rdquo; functions, where <i>new</i> means functions that cannot be expressed in terms of functions you already know, those that are classical elementary functions. Imagine that they satisfy some equations that arise in a wide range of applications. This is the starting point that led to nonlinear differential equations called the <i>Painlev&eacute; equations</i> and <i>disrcrete Painlev&eacute; equations</i>. The aim of this post is to explain the mathematical journey that led to these discoveries.

The journey and its associated discoveries are so broad and the details are so rich that I will have to explain the different elements in different posts. For now, the impatient reader may want to jump in with both feet by watching the <a href="https://www.math.ucla.edu/dls/nalini-joshi">videos of lectures</a> I gave at UCLA or reading the introductory article I wrote for Notices of the <a href="ams.org">AMS</a>, whose <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/notices/202006/rnoti-p797.pdf">PDF</a>  is available.

For those patient enough to go on the journey with me. I invite you to the next post.
